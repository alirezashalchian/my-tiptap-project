1.In items.js the filtering method doesnt work, for example users cant tpye /H to filter
  the extensions and only see those which start with "H"

2.The blockqoute started working when i replaced:

editor.chain().focus().deleteRange(range).setNode("blockqoute").run();

with:

editor.chain().focus().deleteRange(range).toggleBlockquote().run();

but i cant understand why we use different methods for codeblock and blockqoute

3.Toggle button group on bubble menu dont listen to the style of the text and act
  independently, for example if u select a part of the text which is already bold, the
  bold button is not highlighted.

4.Ordered list doesnt toggle, it only seems to set the ordered list, and the user
  cant unset it using the same button

5.The image is not centered yet the styles of the image-wrapper and img itself are 
  applied and it seems like it should be centered but its not, this happened when The
  MUI Joy style was applied to the CommandsList component.

6.Later on for the slash command menu we can use the sticky item from "List" in MUI
  Joy to include categories (subheaders) and subitems
