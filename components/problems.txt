1.In items.js the filtering method doesnt work, also the slash button is not query and we get an error if we delete this part of code:
  if (typeof query !== "string") {
    query = "";
  }

2.The Blockqoute is not working
the blockqoute started working when i replaced:

editor.chain().focus().deleteRange(range).setNode("blockqoute").run();

with:

editor.chain().focus().deleteRange(range).toggleBlockquote().run();

but i cant understand why we use different methods for codeblock and blockqoute
