hey, i am building a text editor using Tiptap and MUI Joy libraries on a Next.js project. i have a slash command menu which contains several extension:
3 heading blockqoute, code block, numbered list, bullet list, image and AI.
AI custom extension is defined in AICommand and uesd in Items.js
CommandsList.js returns items from Items.js and renderItems.jsx handles the rendering process.

I want my AI extension to work like the Notion AI extension ?  meaning that instead of opening a window prompt i want the extension to open up a text input where the slash command was issued.
how can i achieve this ?
