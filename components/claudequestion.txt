hey, i am building a text editor using Tiptap and MUI Joy libraries on a Next.js project. i have a slash command menu which contains several extension: 3 levels of headings, a blockqoute, a code block, a numbered list, a bullet list, an image and Ask AI extension.

AI custom extension is defined in AICommand and AIInput and then uesd in Items.js.

CommandsList.js returns items from Items.js and renderItems.jsx handles the rendering process.

When a user selects Ask AI extension, an input with a submit button gets rendered, and when the user submits their question a dummy string gets generated on the same lane that the user issued the Ask AI extension.

I have done some temporary stylings for the AI input and its submit button, but for the styling of the AI input i want to use MUI Joy library for consistency.

which components of MUI Joy should I use and how should i do it so that nothing breaks in the app.

after using MUI Joy do we still need the useRef and useEffect hook ? If so why do we still need them what are their purpose ?
cant we set the focus on input by giving it MUI Joy props ?
also i want the MUI Joy input to have minimum rows of 5. How can i achieve that ?


can you make a documentation of the whole project so that potential colleagues can use and work on it ?
its important to mention all the dependencies they need to install and also mention what the purpose of each file is and what the developers can alter or add inside of each file (AICommand, AIInputNode, ColorPicker, commands, CommandsList, EditorConfig, items, renderedItems StyledEditorContent Tiptap, Toolbar).
for example where the AI API should be stored.
or how they can add a tiptap node or mark.
Basically i want this documentation to be a guide to any developer who wants to use this rich text editor app on their website.
